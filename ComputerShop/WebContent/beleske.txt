 Following is the syntax to include JSTL Core library in your JSP:
 
<%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>



<c:out >	Like <%= ... >, but for expressions.
<c:set >	Sets the result of an expression evaluation in a 'scope'
<c:remove >	Removes a scoped variable (from a particular scope, if specified).
<c:catch>	Catches any Throwable that occurs in its body and optionally exposes it.
<c:if>	Simple conditional tag which evalutes its body if the supplied condition is true.
<c:choose>	Simple conditional tag that establishes a context for mutually exclusive conditional operations, marked by <when> and <otherwise>
<c:when>	Subtag of <choose> that includes its body if its condition evalutes to 'true'.
<c:otherwise >	Subtag of <choose> that follows <when> tags and runs only if all of the prior conditions evaluated to 'false'.
<c:import>	Retrieves an absolute or relative URL and exposes its contents to either the page, a String in 'var', or a Reader in 'varReader'.
<c:forEach >	The basic iteration tag, accepting many different collection types and supporting subsetting and other functionality .
<c:forTokens>	Iterates over tokens, separated by the supplied delimeters.
<c:param>	Adds a parameter to a containing 'import' tag's URL.
<c:redirect >	Redirects to a new URL.
<c:url>	Creates a URL with optional query parameters

This was my problem and how I fixed it...

I had done everything everyone had mentioned above etc. but was still getting this error. Turns out I was using the uri's of http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt and http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core which were incorrect.

Try switching the uris from above to:

http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt
http://java.sun.com/jstl/core
Also, make sure you have the correct jars referenced in your class path.
